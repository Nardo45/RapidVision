# RapidVision

**RapidVision** is a real-time object detection tool powered by the PP-YOLOE deep learning model
and the COCO object class dataset. It supports switching between multiple video sources and is built
for responsive, flexible object recognition.

RapidVision is currently focused on fast and accurate detection of common
object categories (e.g., people, vehicles, animals, household items) with a
lightweight and modular Python architecture.

> ⚙️ **Planned features** include hardware-accelerated inference
(e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Intel NPU) and support for security surveillance tasks
such as frame recording, event logging, and smart detection triggers.
